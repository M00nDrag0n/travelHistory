## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Its purpose and usage.  Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does, and any other information you want users or other developers to have. }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

 * _Spec: The program_

 <!-- [insert what each simple function that this program does one at a time, FOR EXAMPLE "takes user input", "displays input on screen" "concatenates user input", etc. Should be in the form of overly simplified steps. THE POINT IS: a spec is a step that your program takes so you can do little things to make sure parts of it are working before you immediately overcomplicate it like I do. ]  -->

<!--  first we should get it to work in the console like we were doing before. Next, we should make it spit venom on the screen at the user. Then we gradually add to it until we meet the requirements. Don't copy paste data. We need to understand these concepts because otherwise, the future will be absolute Hell, you won't understand, and they will make you drop out (temporarily(?)). So make sure your understanding of every. little. lesson. is crystal clear so you don't "die".-->
